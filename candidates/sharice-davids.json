      "A fighter for Iowa’s working families",
      "Cindy Axne is a small business owner, mother and community activist running for Congress to fight for Iowa working families. A fifth-generation Iowan, Cindy grew up on the south side of Des Moines and worked for the state government across a variety of departments for nearly a decade, helping hold over twenty different state agencies accountable to taxpayers. A champion for equality, Cindy successfully fought for full-day kindergarten to be available to all children in West Des Moines public schools, not just those who won a lottery. In addition to co-running a digital design and consulting firm with her husband, Cindy currently serves as a mentor with the John Pappajohn Entrepreneurial Center at the University of Iowa, her alma mater. She lives in West Des Moines with her husband and two teenage sons, and is an active member of her church.",
      "A champion for health care and expanding economic opportunity",
      "Cindy is running to expand economic opportunity and create good-paying jobs for Iowa working families. As a small business owner, she has what it takes to fight for commonsense policies that grow our economy and give all Iowans the chance to thrive in their communities. She is dedicated to protecting and expanding all Iowans’ access to high-quality, affordable health care. Cindy knows what it’s like to have health insurance be too expensive for families. When she was starting her small business, she has said that health insurance that included maternity coverage “was completely unaffordable; we couldn’t afford it, so I didn’t have maternity coverage. [...] To afford our medical bills, we sold personal items on eBay because we didn’t want to go into debt or go bankrupt just because we had our son.” Cindy was also one of thousands of Iowans whose health insurance plan was canceled last year amidst Republicans’ attempts to sabotage the Affordable Care Act. When elected to Congress, Cindy will fight to defend hardworking Iowans’ economic security and the rights of the most vulnerable among us.",
      "An opportunity to flip a seat from red to blue",
      "Cindy is challenging Congressman David Young, a vulnerable Republican who has been advancing his party’s dangerous agenda at the expense of the working families he was elected to serve. Young has voted in lockstep with the dangerous Republican agenda, including for the GOP health care plan to kick 23 million people off their insurance — threatening the health care coverage of Iowa working families. This is an opportunity to flip a seat, and a critical race on the path to flipping the House. Let’s show her the full support of the EMILY’s List community and help elect this champion for Iowa working families to the U.S. House in 2018."
